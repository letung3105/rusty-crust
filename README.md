# Rusty crust

This library contains implementations of different data structures. Some of the
data structures will be written from scratched by myself, some will be based on
others' implementations from online courses, Youtube's videos, and live streams.

Motivations:
+ Inspecting the inner working of different data structures
+ Trying out intersting data structures
+ Getting into low-level uses of Rust
+ Learning the standard libraries' APIs
